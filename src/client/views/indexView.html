                    <p>For LGBT people a day may be filled with joy, happiness, sadness or anything inbetween, this isnâ€™t the problem, the problem is the daily inequality a LGBT person may meet. Such as not being able to go outside with their partner without risking getting imprisoned or get married to whom they love.
